        "7": "But Jehoshaphat asked, \u201cIs there no longer a prophet of the Lord here whom we can inquire of?\u201d",
        "8": "The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, \u201cThere is still one prophet through whom we can inquire of the Lord, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.\u201d \u201cThe king should not say such a thing,\u201d Jehoshaphat replied.",
        "9": "So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, \u201cBring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.\u201d",
        "10": "Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them.",

        "12": "All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. \u201cAttack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious,\u201d they said, \u201cfor the Lord will give it into the king\u2019s hand.\u201d",
        "13": "The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, \u201cLook, the other prophets without exception are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably.\u201d",
        "14": "But Micaiah said, \u201cAs surely as the Lord lives, I can tell him only what the Lord tells me.\u201d",
        "15": "When he arrived, the king asked him, \u201cMicaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or not?\u201d \u201cAttack and be victorious,\u201d he answered, \u201cfor the Lord will give it into the king\u2019s hand.\u201d",
        "16": "The king said to him, \u201cHow many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?\u201d",
        "17": "Then Micaiah answered, \u201cI saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the Lord said, \u2018These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.\u2019\u201d",
        "18": "The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?\u201d",
        "19": "Micaiah continued, \u201cTherefore hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the multitudes of heaven standing around him on his right and on his left.",
        "20": "And the Lord said, \u2018Who will entice Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?\u2019 \u201cOne suggested this, and another that.",
        "21": "Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the Lord and said, \u2018I will entice him.\u2019",
        "22": "\u201c\u2018By what means?\u2019 the Lord asked. \u201c\u2018I will go out and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,\u2019 he said. \u201c\u2018You will succeed in enticing him,\u2019 said the Lord. \u2018Go and do it.\u2019",
        "23": "\u201cSo now the Lord has put a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours. The Lord has decreed disaster for you.\u201d",
        "24": "Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. \u201cWhich way did the spirit from the Lord go when he went from me to speak to you?\u201d he asked.",
        "25": "Micaiah replied, \u201cYou will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room.\u201d",
        "26": "The king of Israel then ordered, \u201cTake Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king\u2019s son",
        "27": "and say, \u2018This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.\u2019\u201d",
        "28": "Micaiah declared, \u201cIf you ever return safely, the Lord has not spoken through me.\u201d Then he added, \u201cMark my words, all you people!\u201d",
        "29": "So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.",
        "30": "The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, \u201cI will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes.\u201d So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.",
        "31": "Now the king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, \u201cDo not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.\u201d",
        "32": "When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, \u201cSurely this is the king of Israel.\u201d So they turned to attack him, but when Jehoshaphat cried out,",
        "33": "the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel and stopped pursuing him.",
        "34": "But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. The king told his chariot driver, \u201cWheel around and get me out of the fighting. I\u2019ve been wounded.\u201d",
        "35": "All day long the battle raged, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. The blood from his wound ran onto the floor of the chariot, and that evening he died.",
        "36": "As the sun was setting, a cry spread through the army: \u201cEvery man to his town. Every man to his land!\u201d",
        "37": "So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried him there.",
        "38": "They washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria (where the prostitutes bathed), and the dogs licked up his blood, as the word of the Lord had declared.",
        "39": "As for the other events of Ahab\u2019s reign, including all he did, the palace he built and adorned with ivory, and the cities he fortified, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?",
        "40": "Ahab rested with his ancestors. And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king.",
        "41": "Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.",
        "42": "Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother\u2019s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.",
        "43": "In everything he followed the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them; he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord. The high places, however, were not removed, and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.",
        "44": "Jehoshaphat was also at peace with the king of Israel.",
        "45": "As for the other events of Jehoshaphat\u2019s reign, the things he achieved and his military exploits, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?",
        "46": "He rid the land of the rest of the male shrine prostitutes who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa.",
        "47": "There was then no king in Edom; a provincial governor ruled.",
        "48": "Now Jehoshaphat built a fleet of trading ships to go to Ophir for gold, but they never set sail\u2014they were wrecked at Ezion Geber.",
        "49": "At that time Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, \u201cLet my men sail with yours,\u201d but Jehoshaphat refused.",
        "50": "Then Jehoshaphat rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of David his father. And Jehoram his son succeeded him as king.",
        "51": "Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years.",
        "52": "He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, because he followed the ways of his father and mother and of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin.",
        "53": "He served and worshiped Baal and aroused the anger of the Lord, the God of Israel, just as his father had done."
