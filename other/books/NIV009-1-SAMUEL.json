        "3": "Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the Lord Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the Lord.",
        "4": "Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.",

        "7": "This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the Lord, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat.",

        "15": "\u201cNot so, my lord,\u201d Hannah replied, \u201cI am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to the Lord.",

        "24": "After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh.",

        "16": "If the person said to him, \u201cLet the fat be burned first, and then take whatever you want,\u201d the servant would answer, \u201cNo, hand it over now; if you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll take it by force.\u201d",
        "17": "This sin of the young men was very great in the Lord\u2019s sight, for they were treating the Lord\u2019s offering with contempt.",
