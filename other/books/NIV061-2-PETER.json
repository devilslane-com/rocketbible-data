        "3": "His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness.",
        "4": "Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature, having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.",
        "5": "For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge;",
        "6": "and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness;",
        "7": "and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love.",

        "9": "But whoever does not have them is nearsighted and blind, forgetting that they have been cleansed from their past sins.",
        "10": "Therefore, my brothers and sisters, make every effort to confirm your calling and election. For if you do these things, you will never stumble,",
        "11": "and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.",
        "12": "So I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have.",
        "13": "I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of this body,",
        "14": "because I know that I will soon put it aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.",
        "15": "And I will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things.",
        "16": "For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.",
        "17": "He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, \u201cThis is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.\u201d",
        "18": "We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain.",
        "19": "We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.",
        "20": "Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet\u2019s own interpretation of things.",
        "21": "For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit."

        "11": "yet even angels, although they are stronger and more powerful, do not heap abuse on such beings when bringing judgment on them from the Lord.",
        "12": "But these people blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like unreasoning animals, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed, and like animals they too will perish.",
        "13": "They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you.",

        "16": "But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey\u2014an animal without speech\u2014who spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet\u2019s madness.",
        "17": "These people are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them.",
        "18": "For they mouth empty, boastful words and, by appealing to the lustful desires of the flesh, they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in error.",
        "19": "They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity\u2014for \u201cpeople are slaves to whatever has mastered them.\u201d",
        "20": "If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and are overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning.",
        "21": "It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them.",

        "7": "By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.",
