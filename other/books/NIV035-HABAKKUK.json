        "3": "Why do you make me look at injustice? Why do you tolerate wrongdoing? Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and conflict abounds.",
        "4": "Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never prevails. The wicked hem in the righteous, so that justice is perverted.",
        "5": "\u201cLook at the nations and watch\u2014 and be utterly amazed. For I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told.",
        "6": "I am raising up the Babylonians, that ruthless and impetuous people, who sweep across the whole earth to seize dwellings not their own.",
        "7": "They are a feared and dreaded people; they are a law to themselves and promote their own honor.",
        "8": "Their horses are swifter than leopards, fiercer than wolves at dusk. Their cavalry gallops headlong; their horsemen come from afar. They fly like an eagle swooping to devour;",
        "9": "they all come intent on violence. Their hordes advance like a desert wind and gather prisoners like sand.",
        "10": "They mock kings and scoff at rulers. They laugh at all fortified cities; by building earthen ramps they capture them.",
        "11": "Then they sweep past like the wind and go on\u2014 guilty people, whose own strength is their god.\u201d",
        "12": "Lord, are you not from everlasting? My God, my Holy One, you will never die. You, Lord, have appointed them to execute judgment; you, my Rock, have ordained them to punish.",
        "13": "Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; you cannot tolerate wrongdoing. Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?",
        "14": "You have made people like the fish in the sea, like the sea creatures that have no ruler.",
        "15": "The wicked foe pulls all of them up with hooks, he catches them in his net, he gathers them up in his dragnet; and so he rejoices and is glad.",
        "16": "Therefore he sacrifices to his net and burns incense to his dragnet, for by his net he lives in luxury and enjoys the choicest food.",

        "19": "Woe to him who says to wood, \u2018Come to life!\u2019 Or to lifeless stone, \u2018Wake up!\u2019 Can it give guidance? It is covered with gold and silver; there is no breath in it.\u201d",

        "7": "I saw the tents of Cushan in distress, the dwellings of Midian in anguish.",
        "8": "Were you angry with the rivers,Lord? Was your wrath against the streams? Did you rage against the sea when you rode your horses and your chariots to victory?",
        "9": "You uncovered your bow, you called for many arrows. You split the earth with rivers;",
        "10": "the mountains saw you and writhed. Torrents of water swept by; the deep roared and lifted its waves on high.",
        "11": "Sun and moon stood still in the heavens at the glint of your flying arrows, at the lightning of your flashing spear.",
        "12": "In wrath you strode through the earth and in anger you threshed the nations.",

        "14": "With his own spear you pierced his head when his warriors stormed out to scatter us, gloating as though about to devour the wretched who were in hiding.",
        "15": "You trampled the sea with your horses, churning the great waters.",
        "16": "I heard and my heart pounded, my lips quivered at the sound; decay crept into my bones, and my legs trembled. Yet I will wait patiently for the day of calamity to come on the nation invading us.",
