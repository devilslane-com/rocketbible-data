        "3": "and in the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his nobles and officials. The military leaders of Persia and Media, the princes, and the nobles of the provinces were present.",
        "4": "For a full 180 days he displayed the vast wealth of his kingdom and the splendor and glory of his majesty.",
        "5": "When these days were over, the king gave a banquet, lasting seven days, in the enclosed garden of the king\u2019s palace, for all the people from the least to the greatest who were in the citadel of Susa.",
        "6": "The garden had hangings of white and blue linen, fastened with cords of white linen and purple material to silver rings on marble pillars. There were couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and other costly stones.",
        "7": "Wine was served in goblets of gold, each one different from the other, and the royal wine was abundant, in keeping with the king\u2019s liberality.",

        "15": "\u201cAccording to law, what must be done to Queen Vashti?\u201d he asked. \u201cShe has not obeyed the command of King Xerxes that the eunuchs have taken to her.\u201d",
        "16": "Then Memukan replied in the presence of the king and the nobles, \u201cQueen Vashti has done wrong, not only against the king but also against all the nobles and the peoples of all the provinces of King Xerxes.",
        "17": "For the queen\u2019s conduct will become known to all the women, and so they will despise their husbands and say, \u2018King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she would not come.\u2019",
        "18": "This very day the Persian and Median women of the nobility who have heard about the queen\u2019s conduct will respond to all the king\u2019s nobles in the same way. There will be no end of disrespect and discord.",
        "19": "\u201cTherefore, if it pleases the king, let him issue a royal decree and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be repealed, that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Xerxes. Also let the king give her royal position to someone else who is better than she.",

Let them be placed under the care of Hegai, the king\u2019s eunuch, who is in charge of the women; and let beauty treatments be given to them.",

        "9": "She pleased him and won his favor. Immediately he provided her with her beauty treatments and special food. He assigned to her seven female attendants selected from the king\u2019s palace and moved her and her attendants into the best place in the harem.",
        "10": "Esther had not revealed her nationality and family background, because Mordecai had forbidden her to do so.",

        "13": "And this is how she would go to the king: Anything she wanted was given her to take with her from the harem to the king\u2019s palace.",
        "14": "In the evening she would go there and in the morning return to another part of the harem to the care of Shaashgaz, the king\u2019s eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not return to the king unless he was pleased with her and summoned her by name.",
        "15": "When the turn came for Esther (the young woman Mordecai had adopted, the daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go to the king, she asked for nothing other than what Hegai, the king\u2019s eunuch who was in charge of the harem, suggested. And Esther won the favor of everyone who saw her.",
        "16": "She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal residence in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.",
        "17": "Now the king was attracted to Esther more than to any of the other women, and she won his favor and approval more than any of the other virgins. So he set a royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.",
        "18": "And the king gave a great banquet, Esther\u2019s banquet, for all his nobles and officials. He proclaimed a holiday throughout the provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality.",
        "19": "When the virgins were assembled a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king\u2019s gate.",
        "20": "But Esther had kept secret her family background and nationality just as Mordecai had told her to do, for she continued to follow Mordecai\u2019s instructions as she had done when he was bringing her up.",
        "21": "During the time Mordecai was sitting at the king\u2019s gate, Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king\u2019s officers who guarded the doorway, became angry and conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.",
        "22": "But Mordecai found out about the plot and told Queen Esther, who in turn reported it to the king, giving credit to Mordecai.",

        "4": "Day after day they spoke to him but he refused to comply. Therefore they told Haman about it to see whether Mordecai\u2019s behavior would be tolerated, for he had told them he was a Jew.",
        "5": "When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor, he was enraged.",
        "6": "Yet having learned who Mordecai\u2019s people were, he scorned the idea of killing only Mordecai. Instead Haman looked for a way to destroy all Mordecai\u2019s people, the Jews, throughout the whole kingdom of Xerxes.",
        "7": "In the twelfth year of King Xerxes, in the first month, the month of Nisan, the pur (that is, the lot) was cast in the presence of Haman to select a day and month. And the lot fell on the twelfth month, the month of Adar.",
        "8": "Then Haman said to King Xerxes, \u201cThere is a certain people dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom who keep themselves separate. Their customs are different from those of all other people, and they do not obey the king\u2019s laws; it is not in the king\u2019s best interest to tolerate them.",

They wrote out in the script of each province and in the language of each people all Haman\u2019s orders to the king\u2019s satraps, the governors of the various provinces and the nobles of the various peoples. These were written in the name of King Xerxes himself and sealed with his own ring.",
        "13": "Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king\u2019s provinces with the order to destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jews\u2014young and old, women and children\u2014on a single day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods.",
        "14": "A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so they would be ready for that day.",
        "15": "The couriers went out, spurred on by the king\u2019s command, and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was bewildered."

        "3": "In every province to which the edict and order of the king came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping and wailing. Many lay in sackcloth and ashes.",
        "4": "When Esther\u2019s eunuchs and female attendants came and told her about Mordecai, she was in great distress. She sent clothes for him to put on instead of his sackcloth, but he would not accept them.",
        "5": "Then Esther summoned Hathak, one of the king\u2019s eunuchs assigned to attend her, and ordered him to find out what was troubling Mordecai and why.",

But thirty days have passed since I was called to go to the king.\u201d",
        "12": "When Esther\u2019s words were reported to Mordecai,",
