        "5": "All the sailors were afraid and each cried out to his own god. And they threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship. But Jonah had gone below deck, where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep.",

        "15": "Then they took Jonah and threw him overboard, and the raging sea grew calm.",
