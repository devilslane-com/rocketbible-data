42,8,"Women minister unto Christ of their substance; Christ, after he had preached from place to place, attended by his apostles, propounds the parable of the sower, and the candle; declares who are his mother, and brethren; rebukes the winds; casts the legion of devils out of the man into the herd of swine; is rejected of the Gadarenes, ; heals the woman of her bloody issue; and raises from death Jairus�s daughter."
42,9,"Christ sends his apostles to work miracles, and to preach; Herod desires to see Christ; The apostles return; Christ feeds five thousand; enquires what opinion the world had of him; foretells his passion; proposes to all the pattern of his patience; The transfiguration; He heals the lunatic; again forewarns his disciples of his passion; commends humility; bids them to shew mildness towards all, without desire of revenge; Divers would follow him, but upon conditions."
42,10,"Christ sends out at once seventy disciples to work miracles, and to preach; pronounces a woe against certain cities; The seventy return with joy; he shows them wherein to rejoice, and thanks his Father for his grace; magnifies the happy estate of his church; teaches the lawyer how to attain eternal life, and to take every one for his neighbour that needs his mercy; reprehends Martha, and commends Mary her sister."
42,11,"Christ teaches us to pray, and that instantly; assuring us that God will give all good things to them that ask him; He, casting out a dumb devil, rebukes the blasphemous Pharisees; and shows who are blessed; preaches to the people; and reprehends the outward shew of holiness in the Pharisees, scribes, and lawyers."
42,12,"Christ preaches to his apostles to avoid hypocrisy, and fearfulness in publishing his doctrine; warns the people to beware of covetousness, by the parable of the rich man who set up greater barns; We must not be over careful of earthly things, but seek the kingdom of God; give alms; be ready at a knock to open to our Lord whensoever he comes; Christ�s ministers are to see to their charges, and look for persecution; The people must take this time of grace; because it is a fearful thing to die without reconciliation."
42,13,"Christ preaches repentance upon the punishment of the Galilaeans and others; The fruitless fig-tree may not stand; He heals the crooked woman; shows the powerful working of the word in the hearts of his chosen, by the parable of the grain of mustard seed, and of leaven; exhorts to enter in at the strait gate; and reproves Herod and Jerusalem."
42,14,"Christ heals the dropsy on the sabbath; teaches humility; to feast the poor; under the parable of the great supper, shows how worldly minded men, who contemn the word of God, shall be shut out of heaven; Those who will be his disciples, to bear their cross must make their accounts beforehand, lest with shame they revolt from him afterward; and become altogether unprofitable, like salt that has lost its savour."
42,15,"The parable of the lost sheep; of the piece of silver; of the prodigal son."
42,16,"The parable of the unjust steward; Christ reproves the hypocrisy of the covetous Pharisees; The parable of the rich man and Lazarus the beggar."
42,17,"Christ teaches to avoid occasions of offence; and to forgive one another; The power of faith; How we are bound to God, and not he to us; Christ heals ten lepers; Of the kingdom of God, and the coming of the Song of Man."
42,18,"Of the importunate widow; Of the Pharisee and the publican; Of Children brought to Christ; A ruler would follow Christ, but is hindered by his riches; The reward of them that leave all for his sake; He foretells his death; and restores a blind man to his sight."
42,19,"Of Zacchaeus a publican; The ten pieces of money; Christ rides into Jerusalem with triumph; weeps over it; drives the buyers and sellers out of the temple; teaching daily in it."
42,20,"Christ avouches his authority by a question of John�s baptism; The parable of the vineyard; Of giving tribute to Caesar; He convinces the Sadducees, that denied the resurrection; How Christ is the Song of David; He warns his disciples to beware of the scribes."
42,21,"Christ commends the poor widow; He foretells the destruction of the temple, and of the city Jerusalem; the signs also which shall be before the last day; He exhorts them to be watchful."
42,22,"The Jews conspire against Christ; Satan prepares Judas to betray him; The apostles prepare the passover; Christ institutes his holy supper; covertly foretells of the traitor; rebukes the rest of his apostles from ambition; assures Peter his faith should not fail; and yet he should deny him thrice; He prays in the mount, and sweats blood; is betrayed with a kiss; he heals Malchus� ear; he is thrice denied of Peter; shamefully abused; and confesses himself to be the Song of God."
42,23,"Jesus is accused before Pilate, and sent to Herod; Herod mocks him; Herod and Pilate are made friends; Barabbas is desired of the people, and is loosed by Pilate, and Jesus is given to be crucified; He tells the women, that lament him, the destruction of Jerusalem; prays for his enemies; Two evildoers are crucified with him; His death; His burial."
42,24,"Christ�s resurrection is declared by two angels to the women that come to the sepulchre; These report it to others; Christ himself appears to the two disciples that went to Emmaus; afterwards he appears to the apostles, and reproves their unbelief; gives them a charge; promises the Holy Ghost; and so ascends into heaven."
43,1,"The divinity, humanity, office, and incarnation of Jesus Christ; The testimony of John; The calling of Andrew, Peter, etc."
43,2,"Christ turns water into wine; departs into Capernaum, and to Jerusalem, where he purges the temple of buyers and sellers; He foretells his death and resurrection; Many believe because of his miracles, but he will not trust himself with them."
43,3,"Christ teaches Nicodemus the necessity of regeneration, of faith in his death, the great love of God towards the world, and the condemnation for unbelief; Jesus baptizes in Judea; The baptism, witness, and doctrine of John concerning Christ."
43,4,"Christ talks with a woman of Samaria, and reveals himself unto her; His disciples marvel; He declares to them his zeal for God�s glory; Many Samaritans believe on him; He departs into Galilee, and heals the ruler�s son that lay sick at Capernaum."
43,5,"Jesus on the sabbath day cures him that was diseased eight and thirty years; The Jews therefore cavil, and persecute him for it; He answers for himself, and reproves them, shewing by the testimony of his Father, of John, of his works, and of the scriptures, who he is."
43,6,"Christ feeds five thousand men with five loaves and two fishes; Thereupon the people would have made him king; but withdrawing himself, he walks on the sea to his disciples; reproves the people flocking after him, and all the fleshly hearers of his word; declares himself to be the bread of life to believers; Many disciples depart from him; Peter confesses him; Judas is a devil."
43,7,"Jesus reproves the ambition and boldness of his kinsmen; goes up from Galilee to the feast of tabernacles; teaches in the temple; Divers opinions of him among the people; The Pharisees are angry that their officers took him not, and chide with Nicodemus for taking his part."
43,8,"Christ delivers the woman taken in adultery; He declares himself the light of the world, and justifies his doctrine; promises freedom to those who believe; answers the Jews that boasted of Abraham; answers their reviling, by shewing his authority and dignity; and conveys himself from their cruelty."
43,9,"The man that was born blind restored to sight; He is brought to the Pharisees; They are offended at it, and excommunicate him; but he is received of Jesus, and confesses him; Who they are whom Christ enlightens."
43,10,"Christ is the door, and the good shepherd; Divers opinions of him; He proves by his works that he is Christ the Song of God; escapes the Jews; and goes again beyond Jordan, where many believe on him."
43,11,"Christ raises Lazarus, four days buried; Many Jews believe; The high priests and Pharisees gather a council against Christ; Caiaphas prophesies; Jesus hides himself; At the passover they enquire after him, and lay wait for him."
43,12,"Jesus excuses Mary anointing his feet; The people flock to see Lazarus; The chief priests consult to kill him; Christ rides into Jerusalem; Greeks desire to see Jesus; He foretells his death; The Jews are generally blinded; yet many chief rulers believe, but do not confess him; therefore Jesus calls earnestly for confession of faith."
43,13,"Jesus washes the disciples� feet, and exhorts them to humility and charity; He foretells and discovers to John by a token, that Judas should betray him;"
43,14,"Christ comforts his disciples with the hope of heaven; professes himself the way, the truth, and the life, and one with the Father; assures their prayers to be effectual; requires obedience; promises the Comforter; and leaves his peace with them."
43,15,"The union of Christ and his members shown under the parable of a vine; The hatred of the world; The office of the Holy Ghost."
43,16,"Christ comforts his disciples by the promise of the Holy Ghost, and his ascension; assures their prayers made in his name to be acceptable; Peace in Christ, and in the world affliction."
43,17,"Christ prays to his Father."
43,18,"Judas betrays Jesus; The officers fall to the ground; Peter smites off Malchus� ear; Jesus is taken, and led unto Annas and Caiaphas; Peter�s denial; Jesus examined before Caiaphas; Peter�s second and third denial; Jesus arraigned before Pilate; His kingdom; The Jews prefer Barabbas."
43,19,"Christ is scourged, crowned with thorns, and beaten; Pilate is desirous to release him, but being overcome with the outrage of the Jews, he delivers him to be crucified; They cast lots for his garments; He commends his mother to John; He dies; His side is pierced; He is buried by Joseph and Nicodemus."
43,20,"Mary comes to the sepulchre; so do Peter and John, ignorant of the resurrection; Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene, and to his disciples; The incredulity and confession of Thomas; The Scripture is sufficient to salvation."
43,21,"Christ appearing again to his disciples is known of them by the great draught of fishes; He dines with them; earnestly commands Peter to feed his lambs and sheep; foretells him of his death; rebukes his curiosity touching John; The conclusion."
44,1,"Christ, preparing his apostles to the beholding of his ascension, gathers them together unto the mount Olivet, commands them to expect in Jerusalem the sending down of the Holy Ghost, promises after a few days to send it, and ascends into heaven in their sight; After his ascension they are warned by two angels to depart, and to set their minds upon his second coming; They accordingly return, and, giving themselves to prayer, choose Matthias apostle in the place of Judas."
44,2,"The apostles, filled with the Holy Ghost, and speaking divers languages, are admired by some, and derided by others; whom Peter disproves; he baptizes a great number that were converted; who afterwards devoutly and charitably converse together; the apostles working many miracles, and God daily increasing his church."
44,3,"Peter preaching to the people that came to see a lame man restored to his feet, professes the cure not to have been wrought by his or John�s own power or holiness, but by God, and his son Jesus, and through faith in his name; withal reprehending them for crucifying Jesus; which because they did it through ignorance, and that thereby were fulfilled God�s determinate counsel, and the Scriptures, he exhorts them by repentance and faith to seek remission of their sins, and salvation in the same Jesus."
44,4,"The rulers of the Jews, offended with Peter�s sermon, imprison him and John; After, upon examination Peter boldly avouching the lame man to be healed by the name of Jesus, and that by the same Jesus only we must be eternally saved, they command him and John to preach no more in that name, adding also threatening; whereupon the church flees to prayer; And God, by moving the place where they were assembled, testifies that he heard their prayer; confirming the church with the gift of the Holy Ghost, and with mutual love and charity."
44,5,"After that Ananias and Sapphira his wife for their hypocrisy, at Peter�s rebuke had fallen down dead; and that the rest of the apostles had wrought many miracles; to the increase of the faith; the apostles are again imprisoned; but delivered by an angel bidding them preach openly to all; when, after their teaching accordingly in the temple, and before the council, they are in danger to be killed; but through the advice of Gamaliel, a great counsellor among the Jews, they are kept alive, and are only beaten; for which they glorify God, and cease no day from preaching."
44,6,"The apostles, desirous to have the poor regarded for their bodily sustenance, as also careful themselves to dispense the word of God, the food of the soul, recommend, and with the church�s consent ordain seven chosen men to the office of deaconship; The word of God prevails, Stephen, full of faith and the Holy Ghost, confuting those with whom he disputed, is brought before the council, and falsely accused of blasphemy against the law and the temple."
44,7,"Stephen, permitted to answer to the accusation of blasphemy, shows that Abraham worshipped God rightly, and how God chose the fathers, before Moses was born, and before the tabernacle and temple were built; that Moses himself witnessed of Christ; and that all outward ceremonies were ordained, according to the heavenly pattern, to last but for a time; reprehending their rebellion, and murdering of Christ, the Just One, whom the prophets foretold should come into the world; Whereupon they stone him to death, who commends his soul to Jesus, and humbly prays for them."
44,8,"By occasion of the persecution in Jerusalem, the church being planted in Samaria, by Philip the deacon, who preached, did miracles, and baptized many; among the rest Simon the sorcerer, a great seducer of the people; Peter and John come to confirm and enlarge the church; where, by prayer and imposition of hands giving the Holy Ghost; when Simon would have bought the like power of them, Peter sharply reproving his hypocrisy and covetousness, and exhorting him to repentance, together with John preaching the word of the Lord, return to Jerusalem; but the angel sends Philip to teach and baptize the Ethiopian Eunuch."
44,9,"Saul, going towards Damascus, is stricken down to the earth, and led blind to Damascus; is called to the apostleship; and is baptized by Ananias; He preaches Christ boldly; The Jews lay wait to kill him; so do the Grecians, but he escapes both; The church having rest, Peter heals Aeneas of the palsy; and restores Tabitha to life."
44,10,"Cornelius, a devout man, being commanded by an angel, sends for Peter, who by a vision is taught not to despise the Gentiles; and is commanded by the Spirit to go with the messenger to Caesarea; Cornelius shows the occasion of his sending for him; As he preaches Christ to Cornelius and his company, the Holy Ghost falls on them, and they are baptized."
44,11,"Peter, being accused for going in to the Gentiles, makes his defence; which is accepted; The gospel being spread in Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, Barnabas is sent to confirm them; The disciples there are first called Christians; They send relief to the brethren in Judea in time of famine."
44,12,"King Herod persecutes the Christians, kills James, and imprisons Peter; whom an angel delivers upon the prayers of the church; Herod in his pride taking to himself the honour due to God, is stricken by an angel, and dies miserably; After his death, the word of God prospers; Saul and Barnabas return to Antioch."
44,13,"Paul and Barnabas are chosen to go to the Gentiles; Of Sergius Paulus, and Elymas the sorcerer; Paul preaches at Antioch that Jesus is Christ; The Gentiles believe; but the Jews gainsay and blaspheme, whereupon they turn to the Gentiles, of whom many believe; The Jews raise a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, who go to Iconium."
44,14,"Paul and Barnabas are persecuted from Iconium; At Lystra Paul heals a cripple, whereupon they are reputed as gods; Paul is stoned; They pass through divers churches, confirming the disciples in faith and patience; Returning to Antioch, they report what God had done with them."
44,15,"Great dissensions arise touching circumcision; The apostles consult about it, and send their determination by letters to the churches; Paul and Barnabas, thinking to visit the brethren together, disagree, and travel different ways."
44,16,"Paul having circumcised Timothy, and being called by the Spirit from one country to another, converts Lydia, and casts out a spirit of divination; for which cause he and Silas are whipped and imprisoned; The prison doors are opened; The jailor is converted, and they are delivered."
44,17,"Paul preaches at Thessalonica, where some believe, and others persecute him; He is sent to Berea, and preaches there; Being persecuted by Jews from Thessalonica, he comes to Athens, and disputes and preaches the living God, to them unknown; whereby, though some mock, many are converted unto Christ."
44,18,"Paul labours with his hands, and preaches at Corinth to the Gentiles; The Lord encourages him in a vision; He is accused before Gallio the deputy, but is dismissed; Afterwards passing from city to city, he strengthens the disciples; Apollos, being more perfectly instructed by Aquila and Priscilla, preaches Christ with great efficacy."
44,19,"The Holy Ghost is given by Paul�s hands; The Jews blaspheme his doctrine, which is confirmed by miracles; The Jewish exorcists, are beaten by the devil; Conjuring books are burnt; Demetrius, for love of gain, raises an uproar against Paul; which is appeased by the townclerk."
44,20,"Paul goes to Macedonia, and thence to Troas; He celebrates the Lord�s supper, and preaches; Eutychus having fallen down dead is raised to life; He continues his travels; and at Miletum he calls the elders together, tells them what shall befall to himself, commits God�s flock to them, warns them of false teachers, commends them to God, prays with them, and departs."
44,21,"Paul calls at the house of Philip, whose daughters prophesy; Agabus, foretelling what should befall him at Jerusalem, he will not be dissuaded from going thither; He comes to Jerusalem; where he is apprehended, and in great danger, but by the chief captain is rescued; and requests, and is permitted to speak to the people."
44,22,"Paul declares at large how he was converted to the faith, and called to his apostleship; At the very mentioning of the Gentiles the people exclaim on him; He would have been scourged; but claiming the privilege of a Roman, he escapes."
44,23,"As Paul pleads his cause, Ananias commands them to smite him; Dissension among his accusers; God encourages him; The Jews� laying wait for Paul, is declared unto the chief captain; He sends him to Felix the governor."
44,24,"Paul being accused by Tertullus the orator, answers for his life and doctrine; He preaches Christ to the governor and his wife; The governor hopes for a bribe, but in vain; At last, going out of his office, he leaves Paul in prison."
44,25,"The Jews accuse Paul before Festus; He answers for himself, and appeals unto Caesar; Afterwards Festus opens his matter to king Agrippa; and he is brought forth; Festus clears him of having done anything worthy of death."
44,26,"Paul, in the presence of Agrippa, declares his life from his childhood; and how miraculously he was converted, and called to his apostleship; Festus charges him with being mad, whereunto he answers modestly; Agrippa is almost persuaded to be a Christian; The whole company pronounce him innocent."
44,27,"Paul shipping towards Rome, foretells of the danger of the voyage, but is not believed; They are tossed to and fro with tempest; and suffer shipwreck; yet all come safe to land."
44,28,"Paul, after his shipwreck, is kindly entertained of the barbarians; The viper on his hand hurts him not; He heals many diseases in the island; They depart towards Rome; He declares to the Jews the cause of his coming; After his preaching some were persuaded, and some believed not; Yet he preaches there two years."
45,1,"Paul commends his calling to the Romans; and his desire to come to them; What his gospel is; God is angry with sin; What were the sins of the gentiles."
45,2,"No excuse for sin; No escape from judgment; Gentiles cannot; nor Jews."
45,3,"The Jews� prerogative; which they have not lost; howbeit the law convinces them also of sin; therefore no flesh is justified by the law; but all, without difference, by faith, only; and yet the law is not abolished."
45,4,"Abraham�s faith was imputed to him for righteousness; before he was circumcised; By faith only he and his seed received the promise; Abraham is the father of all that believe; Our faith also shall be imputed to us for righteousness."
45,5,"Being justified by faith, we have peace with God; and joy in our hope; that since we were reconciled by his blood, when we were enemies; we shall much more be saved, being reconciled; As sin and death came by Adam; so much more righteousness and life by Jesus Christ; Where sin abounded, grace did superabound."
45,6,"We may not live in sin; for we are dead unto it; as appears by our baptism; Let not sin reign any more; because we have yielded ourselves to the service of righteousness; and for that death is the wages of sin."
45,7,"No law hath power over a man longer than he lives; But we are dead to the law; Yet is not the law sin; but holy, just and good; as I acknowledge, who am grieved because I cannot keep it."
45,8,"They that are in Christ, are free from condemnation; What harm comes of the flesh; and what good of the Spirit; The glorious deliverance all things long for, was beforehand decreed from God; Nothing can sever us from his love."
45,9,"Paul is sorry for the Jews; All of Abraham not of the promise; God�s sovereignty; The calling of the Gentiles and rejecting of the Jews, foretold; The cause of the Jews� stumbling."
45,10,"The Scripture shows the difference between the righteousness of the law, and that of faith; and that all, both Jew and Gentile, that believe, shall not be confounded; and that the Gentiles shall receive the word and believe; Israel was not ignorant of these things."
45,11,"God has not cast off all Israel; Some were elected, though the rest were hardened; There is hope of their conversion; The Gentiles may not exult over them; for there is a promise of their salvation; God�s judgments are unsearchable."
45,12,"God�s mercies must move us to please God; No man must think too well of himself; but everyone attend on that calling wherein he is placed; Love, and many other duties are required of us; Revenge is especially forbidden."
45,13,"Subjection, and many other duties, we owe to the magistrates; Love is the fulfilling of the law; Gluttony and drunkenness, and the works of darkness, are out of season in the time of the Gospel."
45,14,"Men may not contemn nor condemn one another for things indifferent; but take heed that they give no offence in them; which the apostle proves unlawful by many reasons."
45,15,"The strong must bear with the weak; We must not please ourselves; for Christ did not so; but receive one another, as Christ did us all; both Jews and Gentiles; Paul excuses his writing; and promises to see them; and requests their prayers."
45,16,"Paul wills the brethren to greet many; and advises them to take heed of those which cause dissension and offences; and after sundry salutations ends with praise and thanks to God."
46,1,"After his salutation and thanksgiving, he exhorts them to unity, and reproves their dissensions; God destroys the wisdom of the wise, by the foolishness of preaching; and calls not the wise, mighty, and noble, but the foolish, weak, and men of no account."
46,2,"He declares that his preaching, though it bring not excellency of speech, or of human wisdom, yet consists in the power of God; and so far excels the wisdom of this world, and human sense, that the natural man cannot understand it."
46,3,"Milk is fit for children; Strife and division, arguments of a fleshly mind; He that planteth and he that watereth, are nothing; The ministers are God�s fellow-workmen; Christ the only foundation; Men the temples of God, which must be kept holy; The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God."
46,4,"In what account the ministers ought to be had; We have nothing which we have not received; The apostles spectacles to the world, angels, and men; the filth and offscouring of the world; yet our fathers in Christ; whom we ought to follow."
46,5,"The incestuous person, is cause rather of shame unto them than of rejoicing; The old leaven is to be purged out; Hienous offenders are to be shamed and avoided."
46,6,"The Corinthians must not vex their brethren, in going to law with them; especially under infidels; The unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God; Our bodies are the members of Christ, and temples of the Holy Ghost."
46,7,"He treats of marriage; shewing it to be a remedy against fornication, and that the bond thereof ought not lightly to be dissolved; Every man must be content with his vocation; Virginity wherefore to be embraced; and for what respects we may either marry, or abstain from marrying."
46,8,"To abstain from meats offered to idols; We must not abuse our Christian liberty, to the offence of our brethren; but must bridle our knowledge with charity."
46,9,"He shows his liberty; and that the minister ought to live by the Gospel; yet that himself has of his own accord abstained, to be either chargeable unto them, or offensive unto any, in matters indifferent; Our life is like unto a race."
46,10,"The sacraments of the Jews are types of ours; and their punishments, examples for us; We must flee from idolatry; We must not make the Lord�s table the table of devils; and in things indifferent we must have regard of our brethren."
46,11,"He reproves them, because in holy assemblies, their men prayed with their heads covered, and women with their heads uncovered; and because generally their meetings were not for the better, but for the worse; as, namely, in profaning with their own feast the Lord�s supper; Lastly, he calls them to the first institution thereof."
46,12,"Spiritual gifts, are diverse, yet all to profit withal; And to that end are diversely bestowed; that by the like proportion, as the members of a natural body tend all to the mutual decency, service, and succour of the same body; so we should do for one another, to make up the mystical body of Christ."
46,13,"All gifts, how excellent soever, are nothing worth without charity; The praises thereof, and prelation before hope and faith."
46,14,"Prophecy is commended, and preferred before speaking with tongues, by a comparison drawn from musical instruments; Both must be referred to edification, as to their true and proper end; The true use of each is taught, and the abuse taxed; Women are forbidden to speak in church."
46,15,"By Christ�s resurrection, he proves the necessity of our resurrection, against all such as deny the resurrection of the body; The fruit, and the manner thereof; and of the changing of them that shall be found alive at the last day."
46,16,"He exhorts them to relieve the want of the brethren at Jerusalem; Commends Timothy; and after friendly admonitions, concludes his epistle with divers salutations."
47,1,"Paul salutes the Corinthians; he encourages them against troubles, by the comforts and deliverances which God had given him, as in all his afflictions, so particularly in his late danger in Asia; And calling both his own conscience and theirs to witness of his sincere manner of preaching the immutable truth of the gospel, he excuses his not coming to them, as proceeding not of lightness, but of his lenity towards them."
47,2,"Having shown the reason why he came not to them, he requires them to forgive and to comfort that excommunicated person, even as himself also upon his true repentance had forgiven him; declaring withal why he departed from Troas to Macedonia, and the happy success which God gave to his preaching in all places."
47,3,"Lest their false teachers should charge him with vain glory, he shows the faith and graces of the Corinthians to be a sufficient commendation of his ministry; Whereupon entering a comparison between the ministers of the law and of the gospel, he proves that his ministry is so far the more excellent, as the gospel of life and liberty is more glorious than the law of condemnation."
47,4,"He declares how he has used all sincerity and faithful diligence in preaching the gospel, and how the troubles and persecutions which he daily endured for the same did redound to the praise of God�s power, to the benefit of the church, and to the apostle�s own eternal glory."
47,5,"That in his assured hope of immortal glory, and in expectation of it, and of the general judgment, he labours to keep a good conscience; not that he may herein boast of himself, but as one that, having received life from Christ, endeavours to live as a new creature to Christ only, and by his ministry of reconciliation, to reconcile others also in Christ to God."
47,6,"That he has approved himself a faithful minister of Christ by his exhortations, and by integrity of life, and by patient enduring all kinds of affliction and disgrace for the gospel; Of which he speaks the more boldly amongst them because his heart is open to them, and he expects the like affection from them again; exhorting them to flee the society and pollutions of idolaters, as being themselves temples of the living God."
47,7,"He proceeds in exhorting them to purity of life; and to bear him like affection as he does to them; Whereof lest he might seem to doubt, he declares what comfort he took in his afflictions by the report which Titus gave of their godly sorrow, which his former epistle had wrought in them; and of their loving-kindness and obedience toward Titus, answerable to his former boastings of them."
47,8,"He stirs them up to a liberal contribution for the poor saints at Jerusalem, by the example of the Macedonians; by commendation of their former forwardness; by the example of Christ; and by the spiritual profit that shall redound to themselves thereby; commending to them the integrity and willingness of Titus, and those other brethren, who upon his request, exhortation, and commendation, were purposely come to them for this business."
47,9,"He yields the reason why, though he knew their forwardness, yet he sent Titus and his brethren beforehand; And he proceeds in stirring them up to a bountiful alms, as being but a kind of sowing of seed, which shall return a great increase to them, and occasion a great sacrifice of thanksgivings unto God."
47,10,"Against the false apostles, who disgraced the weakness of his person and bodily presence, he shows the spiritual might and authority with which he was armed against all adverse powers; assuring them that at his coming he will be found as mighty in word as he is now in writing, being absent; and withal taxing them for reaching out themselves beyond their compass, and vaunting themselves of other men�s labours."
47,11,"Out of his jealousy over the Corinthians, who seemed to make more account of the false apostles than of him, he enters into a forced commendation of himself, of his equality with the chief apostles, of his preaching the gospel to them freely, and without any charge to them; shewing that he was not inferior to those deceitful workers in any legal prerogative; and in the service of Christ, and in all kinds of sufferings for his ministry, far superior."
47,12,"For commending of his apostleship, though he might glory of his wonderful revelations, yet he rather chooses to glory of his infirmities; blaming them for forcing him to this vain boasting; He promises to come to them again; but yet altogether in the affection of a father; although he fears he shall to his grief find many offenders, and public disorders there."
47,13,"He threatens severity, and the power of his apostleship, against obstinate sinners; And, advising them to a trial of their faith, and to a reformation of their sins before his coming, he concludes his epistle with a general exhortation and a prayer."
48,1,"He wonders that they have so soon left him and the gospel; and accurses those that preach any other gospel than he did; He learned the gospel not of men, but of God; and shows what he was before his calling; and what he did immediately after it."
48,2,"He shows when he went up again to Jerusalem, and for what purpose; and that Titus was not circumcised; and that he resisted Peter, and told him the reason; why he and others, being Jews, do believe in Christ to be justified by faith, and not by works; and that they live not in sin, who are so justified."
48,3,"He asks what moved them to leave the faith, and hang upon the law; They that believe are justified, and blessed with Abraham; And this he shows by many reasons."
48,4,"We were under the law till Christ came, as the heir is under the guardian till he be of age; But Christ freed us from the law; therefore we are servants no longer to it; He remembers their good will to him, and his to them; and shows that we are the sons of Abraham by the freewoman."
48,5,"He wills them to stand in their liberty, and not to observe circumcision; but rather love, which is the sum of the law; He reckons up the works of the flesh, and the fruits of the Spirit, and exhorts to walk in the Spirit."
48,6,"He moves them to deal mildly with a brother that has slipped, and to bear one another�s burden; to be liberal to their teachers, and not weary of well-doing; He shows what they intend that preach circumcision; He glories in nothing, save in the cross of Christ."
49,1,"After the salutation, and thanksgiving for the Ephesians, he treats of our election, and adoption by grace; which is the true and proper fountain of man�s salvation; And because the height of this mystery cannot be easily attained unto, he prays that they may come to the full knowledge and possession thereof in Christ."
49,2,"By comparing what we were by nature, with what we are by grace, he declares that we are made for good works, and being brought near by Christ, should not live as Gentiles and foreigners, as in time past, but as citizens with the saints, and the family of God."
49,3,"The hidden mystery that the Gentiles should be saved was made known to Paul by revelation; and to him was that grace given, that he should preach it; He desires them not to faint for his tribulation; and prays that they may perceive the great love of Christ toward them."
49,4,"He exhorts to unity; and declares that God therefore gives divers gifts unto men; that his church might be edified, and grow up in Christ; He calls them from the impurity of the Gentiles; to put on the new man; to cast off lying; and corrupt communication."
49,5,"After general exhortations to love; to flee fornication; and all uncleanness; not to converse with the wicked; to walk warily; and to be filled with the Spirit; he descends to the particular duties, how wives ought to obey their husbands; and husbands ought to love their wives, even as Christ does his church."
49,6,"The duty of children towards their parents; of servants towards their masters; Our life is a warfare, not only against flesh and blood, but also spiritual enemies; The complete armour of a Christian; and how it ought to be used; Tychicus is commended."
50,1,"Paul testifies his thankfulness to God, and his love towards them, for the fruits of their faith, and fellowship in his sufferings; daily praying to him for their increase in grace; he shows what good the faith of Christ had received by his troubles at Rome; and how ready he is to glorify Christ either by his life or death; exhorting them to unity; and to fortitude in persecution."
50,2,"Paul exhorts them to unity, and to all humbleness of mind, by the example of Christ�s humility and exaltation; to a careful proceeding in the way of salvation, that they be as lights to the wicked world, and comforts to him their apostle, who is now ready to be offered up to God; He hopes to send Timothy to them, and Epaphroditus also."
50,3,"He warns them to beware of the false teachers of the circumcision; shewing that himself has greater cause than they to trust in the righteousness of the law; which notwithstanding he counts as dung and loss, to gain Christ and his righteousness; therein acknowledging his own imperfection; He exhorts them to be thus minded; and to imitate him, and to decline the ways of carnal Christians."
50,4,"From particular admonitions, he proceeds to general exhortations, shewing how he rejoiced at their liberality towards him lying in prison, not so much for the supply of his own wants as for the grace of God in them; And so he concludes with prayer and salutations."
51,1,"After salutation Paul thanks God for their faith; confirms the doctrine of Epaphras; prays further for their increase in grace; describes the true Christ; encourages them to receive Jesus Christ, and commends his own ministry."
51,2,"Paul still exhorts them to be constant in Christ; to beware of philosophy, and vain traditions; worshipping of angels; and legal ceremonies, which are ended in Christ."
51,3,"He shows where we should seek Christ; He exhorts to mortification; to put off the old man, and put on Christ; exhorting to charity, humility, and other several duties."
51,4,"He exhorts them to be fervent in prayer; to walk wisely toward them that are not yet come to the true knowledge of Christ; He salutes them, and wishes them all prosperity."
52,1,"The Thessalonians are given to understand both how mindful of them Saint Paul was at all time in thanksgiving, and prayer; and also how well he was persuaded of the truth and sincerity of their faith and conversion to God."
52,2,"In what manner the gospel was brought and preached to the Thessalonians, and in what sort also they received it; A reason is rendered both why Paul was so long absent from them, and also why he was so desirous to see them."
52,3,"Saint Paul testifies his great love to the Thessalonians, partly by sending Timothy unto them to strengthen and comfort them; partly by rejoicing in their well-doing; and partly by praying for them, and desiring a safe coming unto them."
52,4,"He exhorts them to go forward in all manner of godliness; to live holily and justly; to love one another; and quietly to follow their own business; and last of all, to sorrow moderately for the dead; And unto this last exhortation is annexed a brief description of the resurrection, and second coming of Christ to judgment."
52,5,"He proceeds in the former description of Christ�s coming to judgment; and gives divers precepts; and so concludes the epistle."
53,1,"Paul certifies them of the good opinion which he had of their faith, love, and patience; and therewithal uses divers reasons for the comforting of them in persecution, whereof the chief is taken from the righteous judgment of God."
53,2,"Paul urges them to continue steadfast in the truth received; shows that there shall be a departure from the faith, and a discovery of Antichrist, before the day of the Lord come; and thereupon repeats his former exhortation, and prays for them."
53,3,"Paul craves their prayers for himself; testifies what confidence he has in them; makes request to God in their behalf; gives them divers precepts, especially to shun idleness, and ill company; and then concludes with prayer and salutation."
54,1,"Timothy is put in mind of the charge which was given unto him by Paul at his going to Macedonia; Of the right use and end of the law; Of Saint Paul�s calling to be an apostle; and Hymenaeus and Alexander."
54,2,"That it is meet to pray and give thanks for all men, and the reason why; How women should be attired; They are not permitted to teach; They shall be saved, notwithstanding the testimonies of God�s wrath, in childbirth, if they continue in faith."
54,3,"How bishops and deacons, and their wives should be qualified; and to what end Saint Paul wrote to Timothy of these things; Of the church, and the blessed truth therein taught and professed."

54,5,"Rules to be observed in reproving; Of widows; Of elders; A precept for Timothy�s health; Some men�s sins go before unto judgment, and some men�s follow after."
54,6,"Of the duty of servants; Not to have fellowship with newfangled teachers; Godliness is great gain; and love of money the root of all evil; What Timothy is to fly, and what to follow; and whereof to admonish the rich; To keep the purity of true doctrine, and to avoid profane janglings."
55,1,"Paul�s love to Timothy, and the unfeigned faith which was in Timothy himself, his mother, and grandmother; He is exhorted to stir up the gift of God which was in him; to be stedfast and patient in persecution; and to persist in the form and truth of that doctrine which he had learned of him; Phygellus and Hermogenes, and such like, are noted, and Onesiphorus is highly commended."
55,2,"Timothy is exhorted again to constancy and perseverance, and to do the duty of a faithful servant of the Lord in dividing the word aright, and staying profane and vain babblings; Of Hymenaeus and Philetus; The foundation of the Lord is sure; He is taught whereof to beware, and what to follow after, and in what manner the servant of the Lord ought to behave himself."

58,1,"We are to rejoice under the cross; to ask patience of God; and in our trials not to impute our weakness, or sins, to him, but rather to hearken to the word, to meditate on it, and to do thereafter; Otherwise men may seem, but never be, truly religious."
59,2,"It is not agreeable to Christian profession to regard the rich, and to despise the poor brethren; rather we are to be loving and merciful; and not to boast of faith where no deeds are; which is but a dead faith; the faith of the devils; not of Abraham; nor Rahab."
59,3,"We are not rashly or arrogantly to reprove others; but rather to bridle the tongue, a little member, but a powerful instrument of much good, and great harm; They who are truly wise are mild and peaceable without envying and strife."
